## Local adaptations to preserve

- The [library-wide adaptations](../../agents/maintain-skills/references/ADAPTATION.md#library-wide-adaptations) apply; this list holds only this skill's own divergences.
- None beyond the library-wide adaptations. The Codex `short_description` and `default_prompt` are locally owned packaging.

## Maintenance

Invoke `/maintain-skills` for the combined maintenance guide and catalog. Its source comparison includes both Pstack and Matt Pocock in one update review. Compare baseline, candidate, and local files; retain intentional adaptations rather than overwriting them. Imported history is immutable. Advance this reviewed-through position only when the relevant delta and shared inputs are resolved and required validation passes.

| Review date | Candidate revision                         | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 2026-10-15  | `49dd158d1076134a641b33efb035946536778336` | Imported the complete pinned skill and resources; adapted host execution, artifact ownership, and delivery boundaries for the combined library. Validate with the combined catalog and targeted workflow fixtures. |
| 2026-10-21  | `5beb35b040e3de97e54fa9e386d7e42d15c295c2` | No upstream change since `49dd158`. First fidelity check: removed an unrecorded closing criterion that contradicted step 3 ("saved at the requested destination" and "actionable choices" versus upstream's `to-questionnaire-<slug>.md` and gap questions); step 3's own criterion is exhaustive. Dropped the old adaptation line, which named no divergence. |
