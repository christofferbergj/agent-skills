- Tracking policy: upstream `main`; inspect the entire public skills inventory for additions, removals, category moves, and relevant shared documentation. Exclude personal skills and the recorded user exclusions.

## Local adaptations to preserve

- The [library-wide adaptations](../../agents/maintain-skills/references/ADAPTATION.md#library-wide-adaptations) apply; this list holds only this skill's own divergences.
- Reversed: upstream sequences every wide refactor as expand-contract. Local delegates the strategy to /pstack-principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis, which holds both the coordinated branch and upstream's expand-contract batches and integration branch, and the graph represents its verification units and compatibility gates. Reason: /pstack-principles owns principle selection, and internal callers alone do not justify coexistence.
- Approval the user already gave for the same slices and edges is retained, so a rerun does not re-ask. Keep one canonical dependency graph with observable acceptance and truthful local or published state.
- Invoke /pstack-principles for decomposition and completion.

## Maintenance

Invoke `/maintain-skills` for the combined maintenance guide and catalog. Its source comparison includes both Pstack and Matt Pocock in one update review. Compare baseline, candidate, and local files; retain intentional adaptations rather than overwriting them. Imported history is immutable. Advance this reviewed-through position only when the relevant delta and shared inputs are resolved and required validation passes.

| 2026-10-15  | `49dd158d1076134a641b33efb035946536778336` | Imported the complete pinned skill and resources; adapted host execution, artifact ownership, and delivery boundaries for the combined library. Validate with the combined catalog and targeted workflow fixtures.                    |
| 2026-10-21  | `5beb35b040e3de97e54fa9e386d7e42d15c295c2` | No upstream change since `49dd158`. First fidelity check: restored the user as the approver of the breakdown, which the retained-approval clause had dropped. Re-recorded the wide-refactor delegation as a reversal with its reason. |
| 2026-10-21  | `5beb35b040e3de97e54fa9e386d7e42d15c295c2` | Dropped divergences now covered by the library-wide adaptations (#18).                                                                                                                                                                |
