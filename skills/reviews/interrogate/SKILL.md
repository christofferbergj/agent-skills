# Interrogate

Adversaries try to break a change or a design. A finding survives only when a run proves it. Report the findings. Do not apply fixes.

## Frame

The scope is what the user names. Otherwise it is the branch diff from its merge base with the base branch, through the working tree. State the intent with /in-your-own-words, from the user's message, the commits, and the PR description. Ask the user when the intent is unclear.

Complete when the scope and the intent are stated.

## Fan out

Run Phase A steps 3 and 4 and Phase B of /arena, with four changes. Seat the adversaries as /swarm's panel for /interrogate's reviewers in place of /arena's runners. Copy the scope's uncommitted changes into each worktree. Spawn each adversary as a writer that runs commands in its own worktree; per /swarm, a counterpart seat whose route cannot run them takes the same-vendor fallback, and the report says so. In place of the arena task and rationale, give each adversary the scope, the intent, and this brief:

> Break this change. Prove each finding with a run against the real code, such as a failing test, a repro script, or command output that shows the wrong behavior. For a design or plan, run a prototype or probe the current tree. Keep repros in your own worktree. Report each finding with a title, the exact command, the output it printed, and the output the intent requires. Leave out anything you did not run. That covers style, naming, structure, and risks that need a future change to matter. No findings is a valid result.

Complete when every adversary has returned its findings or no findings, or is noted as a dropout.

## Verify

Verify each finding per /arena Phase F by rerunning its command. Keep a finding when the output shows the failure and the failure breaks the intent. Drop the rest. Merge findings that share a root cause.

Skip /arena Phases C, D, and E. Adversaries find different failures, so the verdict keeps every verified finding, not one adversary's list.

Complete when every finding is kept on its rerun output or dropped with a reason, and kept findings that share a root cause are merged.

## Output

- **Intent**: the restatement.
- **Findings**: for each verified finding, the command, its output, how it breaks the intent, and the adversaries that found it. Say "no verified findings" when none survive.
- **Dropped**: for each adversary, the count of dropped findings and why.
