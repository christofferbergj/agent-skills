# Multi-PR plan template

The skeleton for the Multi-phase or multi-PR plan playbook. `scripts/check-plan.mjs` checks a filled plan against it.

```markdown
# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `playbooks/<execution playbook>.md` from the installed pstack-mode skill. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] Base ref. <The target branch, resolved from the repository, and its revision.>
- [ ] Read these at program start. Re-read them at every tick.
  - [ ] `<installed path>/pstack-mode/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`
  - [ ] `<installed path>/pstack-swarm/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] `<control surface path>`
  - [ ] `<installed path>/pstack-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`
  - [ ] `<installed path>/<each other leaf skill the program uses>/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Audit cadence. On the operator's go, arm the audit tick every hour with the host's native loop or scheduling tool and the tick prompt below. Never leave the cadence to memory. <When the host has no such tool, the session-bound checkpoints and the durable handoff that replace it.>
- [ ] Use this tick prompt, verbatim. "Re-read the execution playbook. Audit the operation against it and fix drift in this tick. Probe every active lane and judge progress by side effects only. Stand down a stuck lane and dispatch its replacement now. Then post a short status message to the operator in chat only when the audit found a tracked change that no earlier status message reported, such as a PR opened, a code-ready head, a round launched or closed, a verdict, a merge, a stuck agent and the action taken, a blocker added or cleared, or a decision only the operator can make. Name every such change and nothing else. Do not repeat a table, the merged list, or an unchanged blocker. If the audit found none, end the turn with no reply text. Either way, log this tick's row in your decision trail. The row names the items reported, or none."
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `<base ref>`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Resolve the forge once. Default to `gh`, or the repository's established forge CLI, for every PR operation. Never require `gt`.
- [ ] Open the PR as a draft per **Opening a PR**. Use the run's built-in PR tool when it has one, else `gh pr create --draft --base <base-branch>`. A stack child targets its parent branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run a deslop pass before each commit and /pstack-no-comments before review.
- [ ] Triage every Bugbot and security-reviewer comment per `references/bugbot-triage.md` in the installed pstack-mode skill.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before the code-ready report and babysit. Keep that merge base in fix rounds. Rebase again only at merge prep, on a `git merge-tree` conflict with trunk, or on a CI failure that comes from a change on trunk.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] A full swarm runs once, at the code-ready head. Another full swarm runs only for new behavior, a redesign, or a large new diff. A rebase, a merge-conflict resolution, or a minor fix gets a single verifier at the new head. Run each full swarm per /pstack-swarm. One gates lane. The live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf lane from its **Verify, perf** block. Two or more audit lanes, each with its own focus, that read the diff and the receipts and distrust the PR body. The root audits the receipts in the merge-ready report before the verdict.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner, including a defect that a lane filed as a note. A new head gets a fresh verdict, except for results that stay valid under the patch-id rule in `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs in its own isolated environment at the PR head, a cloud VM where the host offers one. Drive through the project's verification skill or the host's control tools.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the control surface's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every screenshot to `/tmp/swarm-<pr-id>/worker-<n>/<slug>.png` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. <N> lanes at the PR head, on the `swarm workers` role, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. Regression lane against trunk. Run <the same load-bearing scenario> at trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that and gate <the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for>. Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane <N>. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change on a lane VM. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the operator's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Bugbot triage done.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the root appends it to the base-branch stack and the operator lands it bottom-up.>

## Close the program

- [ ] Every box above is checked with its evidence.
- [ ] Reply to the operator with the report the execution playbook names.

## Appendix A. Prototype evidence

<Each open question a prototype answered, with the branch, the SHA, and the artifact links. Each question that stays unproven.>

## Appendix B. Alternatives rejected

<Each approach weighed and why it lost.>

## Appendix C. Risks

<Each risk with the PR it lands in and what the owner watches.>

## Appendix D. Links and reading list

<Docs to read before editing. Which PRs get /pstack-how and /pstack-interrogate. The trail per /pstack-show-me-your-work.>
```

For an inapplicable live block, replace its lane sentence and boxes with `Not applicable. <concrete reason>`. For an inapplicable perf block, replace its four boxes with one `Not applicable. <concrete reason>` box.
