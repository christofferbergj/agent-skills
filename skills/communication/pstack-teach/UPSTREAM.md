## Local adaptations to preserve

- The [library-wide adaptations](../../agents/maintain-skills/references/ADAPTATION.md#library-wide-adaptations) apply; this list holds only this skill's own divergences.
- Run /pstack-how and /pstack-why in parallel through /pstack-swarm, and use the host's image-generation tool only when it has one; upstream assumes parallel skill runs and an image tool.
- When an active reply layout such as /reply-shape limits pictures per turn, the diagram build-up continues one diagram per turn instead of all in one reply, because /reply-shape owns reply layout.

## Maintenance

Invoke `/maintain-skills` for repository-wide upkeep, including this suite's supporting files and shared consumers. Reinstalling from this repository refreshes the adaptation; it does not merge Cursor's originals.

Keep the original import fixed. Advance the reviewed-through baseline only after the relevant delta is fully resolved and checks pass. Record adopted, adapted, and excluded changes and their reasons.

| 2026-10-15  | `e5136d82418d2db3165ea1050d17577cd618cc05` | Imported and adapted the complete pinned skill and required resources for the agreed portable suite. Retained original intent; replaced host-specific integration and policy where necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2026-10-21  | `190d28736eff128ec94f502a22c7fe0c4b56cd37` | No upstream change since `e5136d8`. First fidelity check: the local skill was a rewrite that dropped most upstream rules, including the build-up diagram series, the framing-label and pacing bans, the `why` narrowing contract, the target-density style rules, and the Reply line, and added an unrecorded change-on-request exception. Restored the upstream body with installed names, swarm delegation, and an image-tool condition; recorded the model-invoked mode. |
